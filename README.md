## Description
This application is a note taker. It takes two inputs from the user: the note title and note body. Saved notes will appear on a list on the side, to be accessible at any time. Notes can also be deleted by clicking the red trashcan button.

## Usage
To use this application, simply visit the Heroku deployment <a href='https://note-taker-by-ghassan.herokuapp.com/notes'>here</a>.

## Known Issues
- When deleting a note, it will not immediately disappear from the note list. Refreshing the page, however, will remove the note from the list.
